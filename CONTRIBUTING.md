# Contributing to Mini-Projects

Welcome to my Hacktoberfest 2024 web development mini-projects repository! I am excited for your contribute to my project. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to ensure a smooth and productive collaboration.

## Hacktoberfest 2024

This repository is participating in Hacktoberfest 2024. I welcome contributions in the form of web development mini-projects.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your mini-project: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
3. Add your web development mini-project to a new directory.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add: Your mini-project name"`
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin your-branch-name`
6. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Guidelines for Mini-Projects

- Each mini-project should be self-contained and demonstrate a specific web development concept or feature.
- Include a README.md file in your mini-project directory explaining what the project does and how to run it.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and follows best practices for the language or framework you're using.
- Test your project thoroughly before submitting a pull request.

## Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Follow the coding conventions and style guides for the language or framework you're using.
- Include appropriate error handling and input validation.

## No Spam Policy

Pull requests containing any of the following will not be merged:

- Spammy or low-quality code
- Unnecessary or unrelated changes to existing files
- Duplicate mini-projects
- Projects that are not related to web development
- Automated script-generated content

Violating this policy may result in your pull request being marked as invalid for Hacktoberfest.

## Review Process

- All contributions will be reviewed by the maintainers.
- I may suggest changes or improvements to your code.
- Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main branch.
